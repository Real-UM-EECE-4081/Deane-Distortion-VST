# DistortionVST
 
This VST offers two types of distortion (Hard and soft clipping) as well as a 3-band EQ. There are drop menus to select the distortion type and turn on/off the distortion and EQ. The EQ does not work quite as intended as I am still learnig the JUCE framework as well as some theories used in signal processing.
